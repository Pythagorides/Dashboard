## ðŸ“‚ Architecture

- **All PDFs** are hosted externally on **Google Drive** and linked directly from the dashboard.
- **All thumbnails** are also hosted on Google Drive in a dedicated `Images` folder.
- The GitHub repository now contains **only the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** needed to render the dashboard.
- No `.pdf` or `.jpg` files are stored in this repository.

## ðŸ”— How It Works

1. **`entries.js`** contains the `data` array with:
   - The title of each testimony
   - A Google Drive `/view` link to the PDF
   - A Google Drive thumbnail link for the image

3. **`style.css`** controls the layout and appearance.
