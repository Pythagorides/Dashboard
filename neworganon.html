    <h1>A Philosophical and Mathematical Model of Truth or<br><em>#NewOrganon</em></h1>

    <blockquote>
      τοῦ δὲ καλοῦ μέγιστα εἴδη τάξις καὶ συμμετρία καὶ τὸ ὡρισμένον,<br>
      ἃ μάλιστα δεικνύουσιν αἱ μαθηματικαὶ ἐπιστῆμαι.<br>
      <em>— Aristotle, Metaphysics XIII.1078a20–b1</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Back in the early ’90s, the great logician Graeme Forbes, with impeccable Balliol irony, had a one-panel comic taped to his office door: Rodin’s <em>The Thinker</em> captioned “Aristotle Trying to Think of Frege.” Naturally, this suggested the straightforward doctoral project of thinking my way back in the other direction—from the principle results of Mathematical Logic to somewhere in the vicinity of Metaphysics Μ & Ν.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometime around 1996, my resulting dissertation prospectus was approved with the modest title, <em>A Philosophical and Mathematical Theory of Truth</em>. Alas, in temperament I’ve always been more like the mad Wittgenstein than the stoic Frege, and in techné, more like the foolhardy Xenophon than the careful Plato. So the project took twenty years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nevertheless, it has now been completed as promised—with the small exception that, instead of a theory of truth, it became a model. Twenty years ago I loosed that arrow of truth. It is now up to the careful reader to see how close I have come to my mark.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Definition 1:</strong> <em>#NewOrganon</em> is a model of Truth, T = &lt;D, I&gt;, such that every well-formed formula on this page is a member of D, as well as every well-formed formula hyperlinked to any member of D, and I is the interpretation function defined below.</p>

      <strong>D</strong> is a collection of well-formed formulae (wffs). The types of wffs include statements of fact, mathematical formulae, financial transactions, laboratory data entries, and more. These wffs are organized into a set of .pdf documents with an accompanying .xmp metadata library.
    </p>

    <p>
      The .pdfs are ordered and re-ordered to reveal various properties of the system. There are linear arrangements of D as well as complex hierarchical structures. Subdomains are filtered by relevance to properties such as financials, clinical data, and research data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The .xmp metadata tracks every occurrence of each .pdf and its component wffs. Every part of the system always knows its place in the ordered whole (<em>τάξις</em>). Each .pdf filename begins with a date prefix indicating when that data entered D, allowing for temporal and semantic comparisons.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the model can show what was being reported in the news while certain conversations were taking place, or reveal that specific financial transactions coincided with clinical events (<em>συμμετρία</em>). The .pdfs in D are also broken down into their component wffs in spreadsheets and data logs, and summarized in various dashboards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, we have high-level views of the entire model and its arrangement, down to finely granular views of singular statements of fact (<em>ὡρισμένον</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>I</strong> is the interpretation function of <em>#NewOrganon</em>. It assigns meaning to all words and names in D, and determines the truth values of all statements of fact. For the most part, I aligns with the natural language reading of D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exception is that some names in D are pseudonyms. They appear to refer to one person but actually refer to another. Whether a name refers to one person or another is critical to determining truth, deception, perjury, and testimony. These pseudonyms cannot be distinguished <em>prima facie</em>, but are tracked in the metadata.
    </p>

      <em>ἐπεὶ δὲ τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ καλὸν ἕτερον (τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἀεὶ ἐν πράξει, τὸ δὲ καλὸν καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀκινήτοις）</em> — Aristot. Met. [13.1078α]
    </p>

    <p>
      The differentiation of hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BEC) from embryonic hepatoblasts is regulated by a sequenced interaction of transcription factors known as “hepatocyte nuclear factors” (HNF). HNF-6, followed by HNF-1b, initiates BEC differentiation. HNF4 activates hepatocyte-specific factors and contributes to hepatocyte maintenance.
    </p>

    <p>
      These observations suggest a homeostatic relationship between hepatocyte and BEC transcriptional activity. Damage to hepatocytes should upregulate HNF-4 in BEC, driving differentiation toward hepatocytes. Conversely, damage to BEC should upregulate HNF-6 in hepatocytes, driving differentiation in the opposite direction. These shifts should correspond to expression patterns observable during hepatogenesis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of the <em>#PrometheusProject</em> is to model epithelial differentiation in hepatogenesis and liver regeneration, guiding the rational design of transplantable human livers (<em>ἀεὶ ἐν πράξει</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Definition 2:</strong> <em>#PrometheusProject</em> is a model of hepatogenesis, H = &lt;D1, I&gt;, such that D1 ⊂ D is the restriction of T to every well-formed formula on this page and every formula hyperlinked to a member of D1. T and H share the same interpretation function, I.

      <strong>H</strong> is a submodel of <strong>T</strong>. They share the same interpretation function, <strong>I</strong>, but <strong>D1</strong> is a proper subset of <strong>D</strong>, or <em>D1 ⊂ D</em>. That means you can follow hyperlinks from <strong>D</strong> to every member of <strong>D1</strong>, but not the other way around. Every pseudonym in <strong>I</strong> occurs in this section of the domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>D1</strong> consists of manuscripts, peer-reviewed publications, and grant proposals all related to hepatology—the study of the human liver. Qua peer-reviewed inductive science, it doesn’t matter who wrote these papers. What they show about liver is true regardless of who conducted the research, designed the experiments, collected the data, or analyzed the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the occurrence of pseudonyms here shows how logical phenomena studied by deductive science appear in the world, <em>in vivo</em>. More importantly, these pseudonyms have a profound impact on Forensic Science or <em>#UPMCrecycles</em>. They determine whether certain statements of fact are true or false, and help establish the motives or intent behind the actions of the parties involved.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> <em>T</em> shows that Michael Ramon Ochoa is the author of <em>#PrometheusProject</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Proof 1:</strong> <em>Root Facts</em> gives an account of the circumstances of my pseudonymous authorship of these papers. The dashboard tool <em>Items of Judicial Notice</em> tracks the series of state and federal court cases in which those Root Facts have been attested under penalty of perjury.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Root Facts</li>
      <li>Items of Judicial Notice</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Proof 2:</strong> During the years of our collaboration, my ex-wife sent copies of publications to friends and family with handwritten notes attached. The 2001-10-23 handwritten note to my now deceased grandmother is a signed confession by my ex-wife that I wrote the Harvard-sponsored tissue engineering paper under the pseudonym “Erin Ochoa.”</p>

      <li>2001-10-23 Pseudonym Confession</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Proof 3:</strong> I was pressured to continue uncredited writing for my ex-wife while heavily sedated in a locked ward in WPIC. <em>Root Fact 14</em> describes how “She literally had to remove the paper clips and staples from my research materials, and even the wire bindings from my notebooks, to bring them into my locked ward, lest I use them to escape or to hurt myself.” The nursing staff confirmed in the clinical records that “she sent manuscripts for him to work on for her so she won’t lose her job…Pt. busy working on these manuscripts.”</p>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Proof 4:</strong> After fleeing Pittsburgh, I submitted a criminal complaint to Pa. Attorney General Tom Corbett, who forwarded the matter to the Pa. Department of Health. On 2008-05-30 they conducted an unannounced investigation of WPIC, which confirmed that “you were observed working on ‘papers’ for your wife’s program by the nursing staff.”</p>

      <li>2008-06-05 Pa. Department of Health Investigation</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Proof 5:</strong> The manuscript I was working on was <em>2006-07-30 Toward a Computable Model of Epithelial Differentiation in Hepatogenesis and Liver Regeneration</em>. I later applied for a copyright and submitted a preliminary patent application to create a paper trail.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2006-07-30 Toward a Computable Model of Epithelial Differentiation in Hepatogenesis and Liver Regeneration</li>
      <li>2008-05-28 Copyright</li>
      <li>2008-06-19 U.S. Patent Application</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Proof 6:</strong> From 2008-01-29 to 2009-01-20, I sent allegations of corruption and abuse to each member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Pittsburgh by certified mail. The dashboard tool <em>Conversations with the Late, Honorable Ralph J. Cappy</em> documents our entire conversation. Entry <em>2008-10-14 Authorship Analysis to the Board of Trustees</em> breaks down all of the evidence of my authorship claim recovered by that time.</p>

      <li>Conversations with the Late, Honorable Ralph J. Cappy</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Proof 7:</strong> Clones of the hard drive described at <em>Root Facts 70–76</em> contain drafts of papers, compliance letters, and other research materials. These were hand-delivered on a flash drive to the San Francisco FBI headquarters on 2009-02-03 in support of RICO allegations.</p>

    <p><strong>Therefore:</strong> <em>T ⊨ Michael Ramon Ochoa is the author of #PrometheusProject.</em></p>
    <p>
      <em>τὸ μὲν γὰρ λέγειν τὸ ὂν μὴ εἶναι ἢ τὸ μὴ ὂν εἶναι ψεῦδος, τὸ δὲ τὸ ὂν εἶναι καὶ τὸ μὴ ὂν μὴ εἶναι ἀληθές</em> — Aristot. Met [4.1011β25]
    </p>

    <p>
      On November 07, 2008, I served each individual member of the Board of Trustees of The University of Pittsburgh and the Board of Directors of UPMC an actionable complaint of criminal fraud and abuse by members of the Starzl Institute. Exactly two weeks later, The Wall Street Journal published an explosive front-page story by Pulitzer Prize–winning investigative reporter John Carreyrou. <em>Doing a Volume Business in Liver Transplants</em> exposed systemic corruption and abuse within the human liver transplantation program of the Thomas Starzl Transplantation Institute of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).
    </p>

    <p>
      Wild partying and sexual abuse went hand in hand with under-reporting mortality and morbidity rates of both organ donors and recipients. Mr. Carreyrou’s reporting nearly led to the decertification of the institute by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. <em>#UPMCrecycles</em> reveals the story that was never told (<em>ἀληθές</em>).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Definition 3:</strong> <em>#UPMCrecycles</em> is a model of Justice, J = &lt;D, I&gt;, such that every well-formed formula on this page is a member of D, as well as every well-formed formula hyperlinked to any member of D, and I is the interpretation function defined above.</p>

    <p>
      A private individual whose rights and property have suffered malicious damage can pursue justice either through suing the offending parties in open court or by filing complaints with the relevant law enforcement or regulatory agencies. Both civil and criminal complaints have two parts: a statement of the relevant facts and a theory about how those facts show that various laws were broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Root Facts</em> is a series of 250 statements of fact (wffs) in support of a parallel civil suit and a series of criminal complaints. <strong>J</strong>, or <em>#UPMCrecycles</em>, is the online .pdf model of every scrap of evidence, court filing, and law enforcement correspondence collected in support of those Root Facts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The completeness of the data (the domain, D) has been checked page-for-page against every public record certified by state and federal courts, online dockets, appellate reproduced records, USPS certified receipts, and every service list attached to every regulatory or law enforcement complaint in the record. <em>Exhibits Dashboard</em> is a tool for navigating J.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> <em>#UPMCrecycles</em> shows that the Root Facts are true, or <strong>J ⊨ Root Facts</strong>.</p>
